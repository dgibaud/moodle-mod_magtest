<h2>Multitrack test</h2>
<h3>Generating moodle groups from results</h3>

<p>Using the multitrack test will result in a splitting of the participants among the provided categories.</p>
<p>This setting allows activating the group generation feature that will convert the test result into moodle groups within the course.</p>
<p>Generation can take place even if all participants did not answer the test. By the way, there will not be any generation possible if groups already are set within the course. You will have to delete the existing groups if you want to generate groups again from a later attempt.</p>
