<h2>Multitrack test</h2>
<h3>Weighted mode</h3>

<p>If you enable this mode, each answer will be associated a weight that will be added to the relevant category if choosen.</p>
<p>This allows creating tests in which each question may not have the same influence upon the final result.</p>
<p>When weighted mode is on, the default weight is 1.0, which is equivalent not to use weighting.</p>
