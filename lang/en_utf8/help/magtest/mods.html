<p>Magtest implements such magazine tests collecting answers "by category" of answers. The test allows you to define some categories and deploy a set of questions that will have as many proposals for each category.
</p>
<p>When a participants plays the test, he will have to choose one of the possible proposals, after what the category score will be increased.</p>
<p>At the end of the test, the winning category has collected the higher score. A conclusion can be shown to users highlighting the winning sentence, and followed eventually by an overal conclusion.</p>
<p>The resulting groups of participants, sorted by the winning category can eventually be converted to Moodle groups. This module can thus be used as a self-discrimating operator when starting a course session, or when splitting a course population into groups becomes necessary.</p>
